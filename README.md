This repo contains Bayesian inference for the [Birnbaum-Saunders distribution](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3212003) and one of its [generalizations](10.1109/TR.2006.879646) in the presence of right-censored data. This model has potential in accelerated life testing to model machine failure time data.
