This repo contains Bayesian inference for the [Birnbaum-Saunders distribution](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3212003) and one of its [generalizations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1688083?casa_token=sjVQeic66RQAAAAA:p2EYTIpHYUy_Z1QEXXF-KXWYZ62uUR_fmOSgVbpOYFyzb_mQMZ7j4ODno9MbHpVBtOCBCFuv_t4) in the presence of right-censored data. This model has potential in accelerated life testing to model machine failure time data.
